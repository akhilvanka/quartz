Hi, if you don't already know me, I'm Akhil. Welcome, hope you enjoy your stay. This is my repertoire (*fancy words I know*) where I store all my notes.

Check out my [Github](https://github.com/akhilvanka) to see some of my projects, or browse around to see some of my thoughts, it's whatever you're feeling. 
I've resolved myself this year to start following better habits, so this is a step forward towards it. 

If not, do check out my [dashboard](https://dash.imber.tech) where I host many of my self hosted services.

Anyway, that's all I have, till next time.
