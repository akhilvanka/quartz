Hi, if you don't already know me, I'm Akhil. Welcome, hope you enjoy your stay. This is my repertoire (*fancy words I know*), anyway this is where I have all my notes.

Check out my [Github](https://github.com/akhilvanka) to see some of my projects, or browse around to see some of my thoughts, it's whatever you're feeling. 

Anyway, that's all I have, till next time.
